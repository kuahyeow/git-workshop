h1. What is Git ?

Git is a _distributed_ *version control* system [1]

[1] <a href="http://git-scm.com/about">http://git-scm.com/about</a>

h2. Setup

Some house-cleaning here. We assume of course you have Git installed, (hopefully >= 1.7.0).

First thing to do is to setup your identity. This identifies you to other people who download the project.


<pre>
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
</pre>


As a helpful step, you may want to set Git to use your favourite editor


<pre>
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
</pre>


h2. Starting your journey


First, clone this repository:

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/kuahyeow/git-workshop.git
</pre>

Once you have cloned your repository, you should now see a directory called @git-workshop@. This is your @working directory@

<pre>
$ cd git-workshop
$ ls
</pre>

For the curious, you should also see the @.git@ subdirectory. This is where all your repository's data and history is kept.

<pre>
$ ls -a .git
</pre>

You will see :

<pre>
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs
</pre>


h2. The staging area

Now, let's try adding some files into the project. Create a couple of files. 

Let's create two files named @bob.txt@ and @alice.txt@.


<pre>
$ touch alice.txt bob.txt
</pre>

Let's use a mail analogy. 

In Git, you first add content to the @staging area@ by using @git add@. This is like putting the stuff you want to send into a cardboard box. You finalize the process and record it into the git index by using @git commit@. This is like sealing the box - it's now ready to send.

Let's add the files to the staging area

<pre>
$ git add alice.txt bob.txt
</pre>

h2. Committing

You are now ready to commit. The @-m@ flag allows you to enter a message to go with the commit at the same time. 

<pre>
$ git commit -m "I am adding two new files"
</pre>

!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Help-browser.svg/20px-Help-browser.svg.png! Stuck? Ask for help from the workshop staff


h2. Let's see what just happened

We should now have a new commit. To see all the commits so far, use @git log@

<pre>
$ git log
</pre>

The log should show all commits listed from most recent first to least recent. You would see various information like the name of the author, the date it was commited, a commit SHA number, and the message for the commit. 

You should also see your most recent commit, where you added the two new files in the previous section. However git log does not show the files involved in each commit. To view more information about a commit, use @git show@.

<pre>
$ git show
</pre>

You should see something similar to:

<pre>
commit 5a1fad96c8584b2c194c229de7e112e4c84e5089
Author: kuahyeow <kuahyeow@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 17 19:13:42 2011 +1200

    I am adding two new files

diff --git a/alice.txt b/alice.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
diff --git a/bob.txt b/bob.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
</pre>

h2. A necessary digression

In this section, we are going to add more changes, and try to recover from mistakes.

Be forewarned, this next step is going to be hard. We will need to add some content to alice.txt. 

Open @alice.txt@ and type in your favourite line from a song, or:

e.g. Lorem ipsum Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium

Then *save* the file

So now, we have updated @alice.txt@ and we wish to commit it to our @repository@.

What did we change? A very useful command is @git diff@. This is very useful to see exactly what changes you have done. 

<pre>
$ git diff
</pre>

You should see something like the following:
<pre><code>
diff --git a/alice.txt b/alice.txt
index e69de29..2aedcab 100644
--- a/alice.txt
+++ b/alice.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Lorem ipsum Sed ut perspiciatis, unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium
</code></pre>

h2. Staging area again

Now let's add our modified file, @alice.txt@ to the staging area. Do you remember how ?

Next, check the @status@ of @alice.txt@. Is it in the staging area now?

h2. Undoing

Let's say we did not like putting Lorem ipsum into @alice.txt@. One advantage of a staging area is to enable us to back out before we commit - which is a bit harder to back out of. Remembering the mail analogy - it's easier to take mail out of the cardboard box before you seal it than after.

Here's how to back out of the staging area :

<pre>
$ git reset HEAD alice.txt
</pre>

<pre>
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	alice.txt
</pre>

Compare the @git status@ now to the git status from the previous section. How does it differ?

!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Help-browser.svg/20px-Help-browser.svg.png! Stuck? Ask for help from the workshop staff

Your staging area should now be empty. What's happened to the Lorem Ipsum changes? It's still there. We are now back to the state just before we added this file to staging area. Going back to the mail analogy, we just took our letter out of the box.

h2. Undoing II

Sometimes we did not like what we have done and we wish to go back to the last _recorded_ state. In this case, we wish to go back to the state just before we added the Lorrem ipsum text to @alice.txt@.

To accomplish this, we use @git checkout@, like so:

<pre>
$ git checkout alice.txt
</pre>

You have now un-done your changes. Your file is now empty.

h2. Branching

Most large code bases have at least two branches - a 'live' branch and a 'development' branch. The live branch is code which is OK to be deployed on to a website, or downloaded by customers. The development branch allows developers to work on features which might not be bug free. Only once everyone is happy with the development branch would it be merged with the live branch.

Creating a branch in Git is easy. The @git branch@ command, when used by itself, will list the branches you currently have

<pre>
$ git branch
</pre>

The @*@ should indicate the current branch you are on, which is @master@.

If you wish to start another branch, use @git checkout -b (new-branch-name)@ :

<pre>
$ git checkout -b exp1
</pre>

Try git branch again to check which branch you are currently on:

<pre>
$ git branch
  exp1
* master
</pre>

The new branch is now created. Now let's work in that branch. To switch to the new branch:

<pre>
$ git checkout exp1
</pre>

@git checkout (branch-name)@ is used to switch branches.


Let's perform some commits now,

<pre>
$ echo 'some content' > test.txt
$ git add test.txt
$ git commit -m "Added experimental txt"
</pre>

Now, let's compare them to the master branch. Use @git diff@

<pre>
$ git diff master
</pre>

Basically what the above output says is that @test.txt@ is present on the @exp1@ branch, but is absent on the @master@ branch.

h2. Now you see me, now you don't

Git is good enough to handle your files when you switch between branches. Switch back to the @master@ branch

Try switching back to the master branch (Hint: It's the same command we used to switch to the exp1 branch above)


Now, where's our @test.txt@ file ?

<pre>
$ ls
README.textile	alice.txt	bob.txt		gamow.txt
</pre>

As you can see the new file you created in the other branch has disappeared. Not to worry, it is safely tucked away, and will re-appear when you switch back to that branch.

Now, switch back to the exp1 branch, and check that the @test.txt@ is now present.

h2. Merging

We now try out merging. Eventually you will want to merge two branches together after the conclusion of work. 
@git merge@ allows you to do that.

Git merging works by first switching the branch you want to _into_, and then running the command to merge the other branch in.

We now want to merge our @exp1@ branch into @master@. First, switch to the @master@ branch.

<pre>
git checkout master
</pre>

Next, we merge the @exp1@ branch into @master@ :

<pre>
$ git merge exp1
</pre>

Do you see the following output ?

<pre>
Merge made by recursive.
 test.txt |    1 +
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 test.txt
</pre>

You have to be in the branch you want merge _into_ and then you always specify the branch you want to merge.

At this point, you can also try out @gitk@ to visualize the changes and how the two branches have merged

h2. Merge Conflicts

Git is pretty good at merging automagically, even when the same file is edited. There are however, some situations where the same line of code is edited there is no way a computer can figure out how to merge. 
This will trigger a conflict which you will have to fix.

We now practise fixing merge conflicts. Recall that conflicts are caused by merges which affect the same block of code.

Here's a branch I prepared earlier. The branch is called @alpher@. Run the code below to set it up (don't worry if you can't understand it)

<pre>
$ git checkout alpher
</pre>

You should now have a new branch called @alpher@. Try merging that branch into @master@ now and fix the ensuing conflict.

!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Help-browser.svg/20px-Help-browser.svg.png! Stuck? Ask for help from the workshop staff

h2. Fixing a conflict

You should see a @conflict@ with the @gamow.txt@ file. This means that the same line of text was edited and committed on both the master branch and the alpher branch. The output below basically tells you the current situation :

<pre>
Auto-merging gamow.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in gamow.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</pre>

If you open the @gamow.txt@ file, you will see something similar as below:

<pre>
$ cat gamow.txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
It was eventually recognized that most of the heavy elements observed in the present universe are the result of stellar nucleosynthesis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis) in stars, a theory largely developed by Bethe.
=======

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis
Stellar nucleosynthesis is the collective term for the nuclear reactions taking place in stars to build the nuclei of the elements heavier than hydrogen. Some small quantity of these reactions also occur on the stellar surface under various circumstances. For the creation of elements during the explosion of a star, the term supernova nucleosynthesis is used.
>>>>>>> alpher
</pre>

Git uses pretty much standard conflict resolution markers. The top part of the block, which is everything between @<<<<<< HEAD@ and @======@ is what was in your current branch.
The bottom half is the version that is present from the @alpher@ branch. To resolve the conflict, you either choose one side or merge them as you see fit.

For example, I might decide to choose the version from the @alpher@ branch.

Now, try to *fix the merge conflict*. Pick the text that you think is better (Ask for help if stumped)

Once I have done that, I can then mark the conflict as fixed by using @git add@ and @git commit@.

!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Help-browser.svg/20px-Help-browser.svg.png! Stuck? Ask for help from the workshop staff

<pre>
$ git add gamow.txt
$ git commit -m "Fixed conflict"
</pre>

Congratulations. You have fixed the conflict. All is good in the world.

h1. Part II

h2. GitHub

But, wait. There's more. What about this distributed sharing thing with Git ?

To be able to share, we'll need a server to host our git repositiories. GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>) is probably the easiest place to begin with.

h2. Login or sign up with GitHub

Go <a href="https://github.com/signup">sign up for an account</a> at GitHub; Or login into your GitHub account if you had previously signed up.

Hint: You may need to setup git cache your GitHub password - see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git</a>

Then come back here, we'll wait.

h2. Create your first GitHub repository

A repository (repo) is a place where you would store your code. You were practising on your very own repo just now in Part 1!

The following <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo"> tutorial</a> will show you how to create a GitHub repo - which you can then share with others

Then come back here, we'll wait.

h2. Fork a repo

Go to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">this tutorial<a>

Then come back here, we'll wait.

h2. Let's collaborate !

...
